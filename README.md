# donut_plots_with_subgroups
Several generalized scripts for making donut plots that include subgroups

*For now all these take dataframes or tabular text forms as the input data form until I add a way to use lists.*

## Demonstration notebooks


The first notebook that opens in the active session demonstrates a script that makes it easy to make a plot like the following from a dataframe.  
Typical results (**two separate images shown**):

![typical2](imgs/donut_plot_with_subgroups_from_dataframe2.png)

The second notebook shows the underlying code that runs that script and makes a plot like shown in [the example from The Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/163-donut-plot-with-subgroups/).  
Typical Result:


The third notebook shows how to make a plot that includes a summary of the subgroups on the left with a plot with the subgroups on the right.  
Typical result:

The fourth notebook shows how to make a plot much like the third notebook produces; however, this script is specialized for binary data for the subgroups, i.e., they can only have two resulting states at most.  
Typical result:
